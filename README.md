This is Jacob's Bookcase!
This application is an easy way to tell the coolest guy you know (me) which books I need to read.

Technology used:
node.js;
express.js;
MongoDB;
ejs;
dotenv;
Nodemon;

Setup:
Created a Repo on GitHub
Then cloned said Repo onto VSCode
Then all dependencies were installed
Created database on MongoDB
Set up an ENV file to hide MongoDB URI

Implimentation:
Used node app.js to make sure it was listening on port 5500
Then viewed on localhost:5500/
Then pushed it to GitHub
Then set up live render
